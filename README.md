# ox_doorlock
[Documentation](https://overextended.dev/ox_doorlock)

Door management resource, with compatibility for ox_core, qb-core, and es_extended.
Successor to nui_doorlock with less scuff and more stuff.

# Dependencies
[oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)

Doors are stored in a database for ease-of-use and to allow data to be easily cleared or shared.
mysql-async is no longer supported.
- does not support error-catching (pcall)
- people use older versions which do not support parameters as arrays
- it isn't maintained and has issues that will never be resolved

[ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib)(v2.3.0 or higher)
Used for some UI elements (i.e. notifications, progress circle, input), and cache.

[ox_target](https://github.com/overextended/ox_target) (preferred) or [qtarget](https://github.com/overextended/qtarget) (deprecated) or [qb-target](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-target)
(Optional) Used for lockpicking

# Usage
Use the /doorlock command to open the UI and enter the settings for your new door.
Once you confirm the settings, activate your targeting resource (typically LALT) to select the entity (or entities) to use.

Adding any arguments after the command will open the closest door to you, to easily modify it.

#Conversion
Placing nui_doorlock config files into the convert folder will convert the data and insert it into the database.
Success is not guaranteed if using a fork on nui_doorlock, like the qb version.

#Client API
- Use the closest door. Still performs server-side checks, so may fail.
```lua
exports.ox_doorlock:useClosestDoor()
```

- Pick the lock of the closest door. Still performs server-side checks, so may fail.
```lua
exports.ox_doorlock:pickClosestDoor()
```

# Server API
- Get data for door
```lua
local mrpd_locker_rooms = exports.ox_doorlock:getDoor(1)
local mrpd_locker_rooms = exports.ox_doorlock:getDoorFromName('mrpd locker rooms')
```
- Set door state (0: unlocked, 1: locked)
```lua
TriggerEvent('ox_doorlock:setState', mrpd_locker_rooms.id, state)
```
- Listen for event when door is toggled
```lua
AddEventHandler('ox_doorlock:stateChanged', function(source, doorId, state, usedItem)
    if usedItem == 'trainticket' then
        local xPlayer = ESX.GetPlayerFromId(source)
        xPlayer.removeInventoryItem(usedItem, 1)
    end
end)
```
